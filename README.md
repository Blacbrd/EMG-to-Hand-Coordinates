# EMG-to-Hand-Coordinates
A Python program that uses the MYO and electromyography technology to recognise 3D hand coordinates using a deep neural network. It also includes a Godot program for 3D hand coordinate visualisation.
It uses Mediapipe and OpenCV for hand coordinate data collection, the 

# Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* The now discontinued MYO Armband
* Working camera

# Features

* Has a data collection feature for hand coordinates and EMG signals
* Has a tensorflow model that maps EMG signals to 3D hand landmark coordinates
* Has a Godot visualisation that allows you to visualise the hand coordinates that the model is predicting
